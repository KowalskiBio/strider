"""
Low-copy stochastic surface capture — shot-noise-limited detection (Frontier §6).

The deterministic :class:`~strider.surface.transducer.SurfaceModel` returns the
*mean* number of captured molecules and calls an assay "detectable" when that
mean signal clears the read-out floor.  At the concentrations that matter for a
real limit of detection (fM–aM), that is the wrong question: the analyte aliquot
holds only ~10¹–10⁴ molecules, the captured count is a small integer, and its
**Poisson shot noise is the dominant noise source** — not the electronics.  No
amount of amplifier gain beats counting statistics.

This module adds that physics:

  * **Capture is a counting process.**  The number of captured molecules ``N`` is
    Poisson with mean μ = the deterministic ``captured_count`` (compound Poisson:
    a Poisson-distributed aliquot population, binomially thinned by the capture
    efficiency).  Its standard deviation is √μ.

  * **Detection limit via Currie (1968).**  With a blank mean ``μ_b`` (non-specific
    binding) and a Gaussian read-out noise ``σ_read`` (the ADC/TIA floor expressed
    in equivalent label events), the **critical level** (decision threshold) is
    ``L_C = k·σ₀`` with ``σ₀ = √(μ_b + σ_read²)``, and the **detection limit** is

        L_D = 2·L_C + k²            (net counts above blank)

    — the canonical Currie result for heteroscedastic Poisson counting at
    k = 1.645 (the z₀.₉₅ quantile, α = β = 0.05), i.e. ``L_D = 3.29·σ₀ + 2.71``.
    The ``+k²`` term is the shot-noise floor: even with perfect electronics
    (σ_read→0) and a zero blank, you still need ``L_D = k² ≈ 2.71`` captured
    molecules — the textbook zero-background counting limit — to call a
    detection at 95 %/95 % confidence.  The
    :meth:`StochasticSurfaceModel.shot_noise_lod` it produces is therefore higher
    — and more honest — than the deterministic ``SurfaceModel.lod``.

  * **mantis SSA driver.**  :meth:`StochasticSurfaceModel.simulate_capture` builds
    a one-reaction capture CRN (``Analyte → Captured``, pseudo-first-order at the
    diffusion-limited efficiency) and runs the mantis Gillespie SSA over an
    ensemble of seeds, returning the empirical captured-count distribution.  It
    reproduces the Poisson model and demonstrates the
    sequences → mantis → surface pipeline at single-molecule resolution.

NUPACK has no surface, no kinetics, and no stochastic mode at all; this is
several layers past what it can express.  All SI units; concentrations in molar.
